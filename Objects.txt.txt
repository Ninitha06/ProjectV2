Hints:

By skipping some numbers in the position property between two buildings, you can
create empty spaces.
Try and organise buildings of differing heights so that smaller buildings do not fall in
the shadow of the bigger ones, and hence get less light and air.
Build buildings of differing heights, to give your city a unique character.
